/**
 * MCP facade over the `croft` CLI.
 *
 * It holds ZERO logic. Every tool shells out to the same binary a human or a
 * shell-capable agent would run, so there is exactly one implementation of
 * every behaviour. Anything that ends up here and not in the CLI is a bug.
 *
 * The reverse is not a bug but it is a cost, and it was never policed: this
 * exposed no knowledge tools at all for as long as knowledge has existed, so
 * an MCP-only agent could not read or write the memory half of the product
 * and was not told it existed. Worse, `croft_check` returns knowledge rows
 * and described itself as an index of tasks, sending agents to `croft_show`
 * with a slug it cannot open. When a verb is deliberately left out, say so
 * here rather than leaving its absence to be discovered.
 *
 * Why bother, given the CLI exists: Codex's [mcp_servers.*] gives per-tool
 * timeouts and approval modes, Claude Code enforces the tool schemas so the
 * model cannot invent flags, and OpenClaw can reach it through mcporter.
 *
 * Requires `croft` on PATH, plus CROFT_BASE_URL and CROFT_API_KEY (or
 * ~/.croft/env, which the CLI reads itself).
