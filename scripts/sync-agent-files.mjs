/**
 * One copy of each agent-facing file, everywhere it has to live.
 *
 * The skill, the CLI and the two hooks are read from a directory per runtime,
 * so the same file exists four, five, six times across a laptop and a server.
 * They drift silently, and the drift is invisible until an agent behaves
 * differently from its siblings for reasons nobody can see. Both halves of
 * that bit in one day: a skill copy a day out of date, and a CLI three days
 * old that was still writing under the wrong identity — the very bug the day
 * had been spent fixing.
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-agent-files.mjs --check   # report drift, write nothing
 *   node scripts/sync-agent-files.mjs           # make every reachable copy match
 *
 * Targets that do not apply to this machine are skipped, not invented: a file
 * in a directory no runtime reads is worse than no file at all. The built-in
 * targets are this user's own; anything else — another user's home, a runtime
 * with a tree of its own — is named by `--also`, because which copies exist is
 * a fact about a machine rather than about Croft.
