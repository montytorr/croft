/**
 * Wires Croft's memory hooks into the agent runtimes on this machine.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, the same two everywhere:
 *   session start  -> inject the briefing
 *   session end    -> record what happened, checkpoint what is still held
 *
 * There used to be a third, PreToolUse(Read) -> what is known about that file.
 * It was taken out by hand on every machine (CCS-40): it had no cache and no
 * debounce, so every Read in every session cost a node spawn and a fresh
 * HTTPS request, and on Codex, which has no Read tool, it never matched at
 * all. This installer went on writing it back, so it now removes it instead —
 * only its own entry; anyone else's PreToolUse hooks are left where they are.
 * The hook script still answers a PreToolUse event for anyone who wires it by
 * hand.
 *
 * Idempotent: run it again after an upgrade and it replaces its own entries
 * without touching anyone else's. Every entry it owns is tagged, and tagging
 * is how it knows what is safe to replace.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/install-hooks.mjs [--dry-run] [--openclaw]
 *
 * `croft setup` runs this for you, alongside pairing keys and copying the
 * skill; run it by hand only to re-wire the hooks on their own.

 * the hooks fired, the key authenticated, the parser worked. The trigger simply
 * never came.
 *
 * So PreCompact as well. A long session compacts repeatedly, and compaction is
 * the one event that is guaranteed to happen to a session too long to end --
 * it is what happens INSTEAD of ending. Recording there costs nothing extra in
 * correctness, because `croft session end` upserts on (platform, id): the row
 * is rewritten in place, progressively richer, and the compaction that finally
 * precedes a real SessionEnd just writes the same row once more.
