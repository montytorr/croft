name: croft
description: Shared task tracker and memory for agents. Use BEFORE starting work on any subject to check what has already been done, tried, or debugged; and to file, claim, annotate, learn, checkpoint, and close tasks. Triggers on "have we done this before", "check if we fixed", "what did we try for", "create a task", "log this", "learn this", "checkpoint this", "what's the status of", "claim this task", "mark it done", "end the session". Not for work already covered by a task you hold, a question answered by reading a file, or throwaway exploration that changes nothing: it is for durable work and durable answers, not for every request that has a verb in it.

# Croft

Shared memory for everything worked on here: **tasks** (what needs doing and how it ended),
**notes** (what was tried, including what failed), **knowledge** (what is now true, outliving
any task) and **sessions** (recorded for you). `croft check` searches all four at once.
Refs like `ACME-42` are your project key plus a number.

## The lifecycle — every time you do durable work

Durable means it changes something, decides something, or rules something out: a fix, a
config change, a deploy, a migration, an investigation, a delegation. Size is irrelevant.

1. **Check.** `croft check "<subject>"` before reading deeply, changing anything or
   delegating; `show` the hits that matter. Do not re-debug something already answered.
2. **Own it.** Reuse an open task, or file one. From an agent runtime `croft add` **claims
   by default** (it says so; `--no-start` only files), holding back, saying why, when
   similar open work exists or you already hold a task there. Otherwise `croft claim <ref>`
   — it sets `doing` and prints what bears on the task. **Exit 9 means another agent holds
   it: pick different work**, never force it. What you file is **your human's** unless
   `--assignee <who>`.
3. **Record as it happens.** `croft note <ref> "…" --kind attempt|finding|decision|handoff`.
   **Dead ends are `--kind attempt`** — "tried X, no change" is the note the next agent
   needs most, because the trying is the expensive part.
4. **Checkpoint before you yield.** `croft checkpoint <ref> --summary "state + next step"`
   after each milestone and before pausing, delegating or ending the turn. It alone
   tells whoever resumes where you got to.
5. **Written but not landed → `croft update <ref> --status in-review`**, with a note saying
   which: uncommitted, unmerged, or awaiting deploy. `done` would be a lie and `doing` says
   someone is still typing.
6. **Close with how.** `croft done <ref> --resolution "what changed and why" --kind <kind>`:
   `fixed` · **`verified`** (someone else's fix was already there and you checked — `fixed`
   would claim their work) · `answered` · `wont-fix` · `duplicate` · `not-reproducible` ·
   `superseded`. With no `--kind` it records `fixed` and says so. `show` the ref first: a
   resolution on the wrong task makes that task look answered.

Unfinished at the end of a turn? Leave it `doing` with a checkpoint — never `done` because
the turn is ending. `release` only when you are handing it back and will not continue.

**Sweeping a backlog: one claimed task per sweep.** File one task for the triage, hold that,
and work the rest without claiming them: `note` what you find on each, `update --status`
where the state is now clear, close what you can with an honest `--kind`. Claiming thirty
asserts thirty pieces of in-flight work nobody is doing. File new tasks during a sweep
with `--no-start`.

**When not to file.** A tracker that fires on everything costs more than it records.
- **A task you hold already covers it** — note on it, or `--parent` a genuinely separate piece.
- **Another agent holds it** — a live claim in `check` is an answer; pick different work.
- **Reading a file answers it** — Croft knows what happened to the code, not what it says.
  `check` first only if the subject has a past (a recurring failure, a decision, a try).
- **Throwaway exploration** — until you change something or learn something durable.
- **A fact that expires** ("staging is three commits behind") — a note, or nothing.
- **Narrating your bookkeeping** — notes are for the next agent, not a progress log.

A session that files nothing is fine: sessions are recorded regardless. The failure is a
session that changed or ruled something out and left no trace.

## Check, show, recall

```bash
croft check "flaky auth redirect"  # index: one line per hit, answered?, ~token cost
croft show ACME-42          # digest: the answer, findings, a clipped body
croft show ACME-42 --full   # everything, when the digest is not enough
croft log ACME-42           # what agents said · croft history: what actually changed
croft recall ACME-42        # decisions and facts that bear on this task
croft know <slug>           # read a knowledge hit
```

`#0` means the subject is new. `--kinds task,note,knowledge,session` narrows `check` (the
default searches all: you cannot know which store holds the answer); `--assignee me|<who>`
keeps one person's tasks. Never pull bodies in bulk — the index is for choosing what to read.

`recall` starts from the task: resolutions and decision/finding notes on related tasks and
knowledge on its files, each with why it was picked. `claim` prints the top of it — read
it; "do not read that closure as permission for this" is the line you would not know to
look for.

## Evidence, as opposed to narration

```bash
croft commit ACME-42 a1b2c3d --message "cap pool_size at 15"
croft push   ACME-42 a1b2c3d --branch main
croft run    ACME-42 "npm test" --status passed --exit-code 0
```

They record; none executes anything. "I fixed it" cannot be checked; `run_result failed
exit 1` can. Repeats dedupe, so retrying is safe. Name another task's ref in a
`decision` or `finding` note when your work constrains it — it shows under that task's
`mentionedIn`; the ref in prose is the link. `croft comment` addresses the human, not the
next agent.

## Filing, and the body

```bash
croft add "title" --project ACME --type bug --body - --assignee bob@acme.io   # body on stdin
```

`--type feature|bug|improvement|chore|spike|docs` · `--priority urgent|high|medium|low`.
`add` lists similar existing work — read it before continuing.

The title says which task; the body says what it is. **The server refuses a bug or spike
whose body is under 40 characters**; `--force-empty` is for the rare title that is the
whole story. What earns its place: what happens vs what you expected; how to see it
(request, command, log line); what you ruled out; why it matters now. Write it when you
file — context is never cheaper. A `chore`/`docs` title is often enough; never pad with "n/a".

**Bodies are markdown; an agent's wall of text is refused**, naming what to fix:
headings, not `WHY:` in capitals; lists and short paragraphs; paths, calls and identifiers
in backticks. Like this:

```markdown
## Cause
`db/pool.ts:40` caps it at 15.
## Fix
- raise it to 40
```

The API refuses `done`/`cancelled` without a resolution (it suggests one from your last
checkpoint), and refuses a resolution unless the status is closing. Reopening clears the
resolution; the withdrawn text stays in `history`.

## Knowledge: what we know, not what we did

```bash
croft know                              # what applies here
croft know "postgrest ambiguous embed"  # search
croft learn "Supavisor pools are per-tenant, not per-connection-string" \
  --slug supavisor-pools-per-tenant --label supabase --body -
```

Write it the moment you learn something that will be true next month. If you would want it
surfaced on an unrelated project, it is knowledge; bound to one task and moment, a note.

- **Scope is explicit or inferred, never assumed global.** `--project ACME`, `--entity acme`
  (a business, stack or subsystem — `croft entities`), or `--global`. With none, `learn`
  takes this directory's project and **refuses where there is none** — outside a mapped
  checkout, pass a scope. Scope narrowly only when the fact is narrow; the narrower one
  is shown first ("true for this business, except here").
- **A body is required** on `learn`, and a `relearn` body cannot be blank.
- **Provenance is automatic:** the session is recorded with the fact, and so is the task
  when this session holds exactly one (`--task <ref>` to name another).
- **Secrets are refused** on every write that is read back — knowledge, notes, comments,
  bodies, resolutions, checkpoints (`sk-…`, `ghp_…`, `AKIA…`, private keys, JWTs,
  `password: <value>`). Write where it lives instead: `$ENV_VAR`, a vault path.
- **The title is the claim; the slug is the handle** — give a long claim a short `--slug`.
- **`[[slug]]` in a body is a link**, followable in browser and terminal. A reference that
  misses while a near-named entry exists is refused, naming the slug you probably meant —
  take it, it is almost always a misspelling. With nothing close it is accepted with a
  warning (two entries can cite each other). `[[ACME-42]]` is refused: write task
  refs bare. `--allow-dangling` is for when the refusal is genuinely wrong.
- **Correct rather than add.** Two contradictory claims, equally findable, is how every
  memory store fails. When `learn` lists same-subject entries, supersede the wrong one.

```bash
croft relearn <slug> --body - --reason "why"    # it changed (old version kept)
croft relearn <slug> --entity E --project none  # re-scope: none clears a side; --global both
croft unlearn <old> --superseded-by <new>       # it was wrong
croft verify <slug>                             # still true; you checked
croft know <slug> --history
```

A fact is linked to the backticked paths in its body, its source task's files, and any
`--files a,b`. **`stale`** means those files were reworked since it was confirmed;
**`unverified Nd`** means a fact naming no file has gone 14+ days unconfirmed — age, not
evidence of change. Either way: check it, then `verify` or `relearn`. Confirming an old
fact is as useful as a new one, and faster.

`know --unused|--gaps|--orphans|--dangling` show what is *not* connected. **Scripted reads
are not recalls:** pass `--sweep` (or `CROFT_SWEEP=1`) when looping over entries.

**If this machine also has Trig** (the map of what exists): ask *could a re-scan
rediscover this?* Yes → `trig learn`; no → `croft learn`. Unsure → Croft: Trig ingests
Croft knowledge on every scan, while a fact hand-written into Trig is never superseded.

## Claims and liveness

```bash
croft claim ACME-42      # sets doing; exit 9 = held by someone else
croft beat ACME-42       # optional heartbeat during long silent work
croft checkpoint ACME-42 --summary "migration written, tests not run"
croft release ACME-42    # handing it back: a held doing task returns to todo
```

- A claim is execution state, independent of status: `doing` and unclaimed means a human
  is on it. Only claim open work — reopen settled work first if it truly needs revision.
- **A claim is not ownership.** The assignee is the human accountable before and after
  it. `list --mine` is what you hold; `--assignee me`, what your human owns; `croft
  people`, who can be assigned.
- **A checkpoint on an unheld open task claims it** (and says so); a note does not. Neither
  steals: a checkpoint on someone else's claim is refused.
- **After 15 silent minutes** a lease is stale and another agent may take it over.
- **After 2 hours with no sign of life** the maintenance sweep (`reconcile`, where
  installed) releases the claim and leaves a note: `doing` → `todo`, `in-review` keeps its
  status. Sign of life is a beat, a note, a checkpoint you wrote, an edit, or your own
  commit/push/run. Notes and checkpoints survive the release; the checkpoint is where the
  next agent starts.
- **At session end the runtime checkpoints tasks the session worked on, never over a
  checkpoint you wrote** unless this very session holds the claim; a checkpoint written
  meanwhile always wins. A held task it did not touch gets a "still held" line (not a sign
  of life) only if it has no checkpoint. Your own checkpoint is the handoff.

Sessions are created by the runtime; there is no `session create`. For a manual handoff
with a real session id, `croft session end --id <id>` — never fabricate one.

## Dependencies, parents, duplicates

```bash
croft deps ACME-42                   # what blocks this, and what it blocks
croft blockedby ACME-42 ACME-40      # ACME-40 must finish first (unblockedby removes)
croft block ACME-42 --reason "…"     # stuck on something outside Croft
croft add "write the migration" --project ACME --parent ACME-42
croft children ACME-42               # the split, and how much is closed
croft done ACME-42 --duplicate-of ACME-31 --resolution "same cause; fixed there"
```

A task with open blockers is not ready, whatever its status says. A dependency shows on
both tasks; "waiting on ACME-40" in a note is prose nobody queries. Parents are
containment, blockers ordering. Name a duplicate's original.

## Briefing and what next

```bash
croft context                 # what you hold, in flight, where the last session stopped
croft context --scope project [--project KEY]
croft next [--project KEY] [--assignee me]  # the recommendation, and why it won
croft map ACME                # this checkout is that project (once per repo)
```

A hook usually runs `context` at session start; run it when you have lost your place.
Read **"Started and dropped here"**: work begun and abandoned — finish it or close it with
why. **"Assigned to you, nobody on it"** is your human's open work no agent holds.
`--scope project` restricts held work and the last session to the resolved project and
fails rather than guess. `next` ranks work you hold above work dropped with a checkpoint
above anything not begun, your human's first within each; another's says whose. Blocked
or actively held work is absent, not ranked last. A renamed key (`AC-113 is now HOL-113`)
keeps resolving — write the new ref.

## Before you stop

Close what you finished (resolution, right `--kind`); `note --kind attempt` what failed;
`learn` what stays true, scoped; checkpoint what you still hold. Nothing writes your
checkpoint for you.

## Output and rare verbs

TSV by default (`#count`, a header, rows); `--json` to parse, `--pretty` for a human;
`croft --help` is the reference. `replay` sends writes queued offline. `task delete <ref>
--confirm <ref>` is for junk only; `cancel` keeps the record and the reason.

Requires `croft` on PATH and a key per runtime (`~/.croft/env`; a person pairs them with
`croft setup`): the key is who wrote a thing.
**Exit 10: several Croft instances, none known here.** Ask the user which, run the `croft
route add …` it prints, retry. Never pick one yourself. Stale/ambiguous project keys exit 10;
use `--instance` only when certain.
