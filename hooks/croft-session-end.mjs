/**
 * The write-without-being-asked half of Croft's memory.
 *
 * Runs when a session ends and records what happened: the request, what was
 * learned, what got done, where it was left, which files were touched and
 * which tasks were worked. Then it checkpoints anything the agent is still
 * holding, so a claim nobody released stops looking like live work.
 *
 * Everything except four prose fields is read straight out of the transcript.
 * That split is the whole economics of this: the store this replaces spent a
 * model call on every tool call, ~1,114 billed turns a day, to produce a
 * corpus consulted a hundred times in seventeen days. One call per session is
 * roughly fifty a day, and the summary is the part that was worth keeping.
 *
 * If the summariser is unavailable or slow, the row is still written with the
 * deterministic half. A session with files and task refs and no prose is
 * useful; a session that was never recorded is not.

/**
 * The summariser is the only part of this that costs money, and Codex calls it
 * on every turn.
 *
 * Codex had no SessionEnd, so `install-hooks.mjs` wired the recorder to Stop,
 * which fires at the end of each assistant turn — and still does, as a live
 * checkpoint (`--ongoing`), beside the SessionEnd that now closes the session
 * (CROFT-319). `record()` then summarised
 * unconditionally: a forty-turn session made forty model calls, each with up
 * to 24 KB of transcript, to write and rewrite one row. The row was always
 * right -- `croft session end` upserts on (platform, id) -- but the calls
 * multiplied, which is the exact economics the comment at the top of this file
 * says the design escaped. Nobody chose one call per turn; it arrived because
 * Stop was the only event Codex had.
 *
 * Two rules, and between them they cost nothing in quality:
 *
 *   - If the digest is byte-for-byte what was last summarised for this
 *     session, the model would return what it returned before. Reuse it.
 *   - Otherwise, if the last call for this session was under
 *     CROFT_SUMMARY_MIN_INTERVAL_MS ago, reuse it anyway. The deterministic
 *     half -- files, task refs, counts -- is still written fresh every time,
 *     and a row with slightly older prose beats a row rewritten forty times.
 *
 * Reuse rather than omission on purpose: leaving the prose out would blank
 * fields that already held something true.
 *
 * The digest is capped at MAX_DIGEST_CHARS, so its LENGTH stops changing once
 * a session is long. Its CONTENT does not -- the tail moves -- so this hashes
 * rather than measures.
