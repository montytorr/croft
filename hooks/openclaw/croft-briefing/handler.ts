/**
 * OpenClaw's half of "inject the briefing at session start".
 *
 * OpenClaw has no session-start hook that can return text. What it has is
 * `agent:bootstrap`, fired before the workspace's bootstrap files are injected,
 * with `context.bootstrapFiles` open to mutation. So the briefing arrives as
 * one more bootstrap file: a short rule, then live `croft context` output for
 * the agent's workspace.
 *
 * The rule travels with the data because it is the one piece of the lifecycle
 * an OpenClaw agent reliably sees. Its AGENTS.md is hand-maintained per
 * machine and drifts; the skill is read in about half of sessions. A briefing
 * that carried data only told the agent what exists, never what to do next.
 *
 * Same rules as hooks/croft-context.mjs: never block (a 5 s deadline, and every
 * failure leaves the session starting as it would have without this hook), and
 * stay small. Unlike that hook it still injects the rule when the CLI fails,
 * because an agent that cannot reach Croft should still know how to use it.
 *
 * No imports from OpenClaw: the hook is linked from outside its tree, so the
 * types below are the subset of its documented event this reads.

- Record: \`croft note <ref> "…" --kind attempt|finding|decision|handoff\`. Dead ends are \`attempt\`.
- \`croft checkpoint <ref> --summary "state + next step"\` before yielding. Written but not landed: \`croft update <ref> --status in-review\`.
- Close: \`croft done <ref> --resolution "…" --kind fixed|verified|answered|wont-fix|duplicate|superseded\` (\`verified\` when the fix was already there).
