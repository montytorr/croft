/**
 * The inject-without-being-queried half of Croft's memory.
 *
 * Reads a hook payload on stdin and prints the runtime's context response.
 * Claude Code and Codex share a wire format. Hermes Agent by Nous Research
 * injects context from `pre_llm_call`, whose response protocol is different.
 *
 * Three rules govern everything here:
 *
 *   1. Never block. A memory system that can stop a session from starting is
 *      worse than no memory system. Every failure path prints nothing and
 *      exits 0.
 *   2. Never speak when there is nothing to say. An empty heading every
 *      session trains the reader to skip the block, which is how a 12 KB
 *      digest ends up being consulted a hundred times in seventeen days.
 *   3. Stay small. This is a briefing, not a corpus.
