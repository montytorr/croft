/**
 * Which runtime is this, and therefore whose key signs the write.
 *
 * A live Codex session was found running as `node /usr/bin/codex --yolo` with
 * no CODEX_HOME — the wrapper installed to set it had simply been bypassed —
 * so detection returned nothing, the CLI fell back to the machine's default
 * key, and every Codex write on that host was filed as OpenClaw. The
 * statistics looked healthy; they were about the wrong agent.
 *
 * The ordering is the part that must not regress: OpenClaw runs Codex
 * underneath, so every Codex marker is also set inside OpenClaw. Testing for
 * Codex first would relabel all of OpenClaw's work as Codex — the same
 * misattribution, pointing the other way.
