/**
 * One set of cases for the two places that decide whether a claim is alive.
 *
 * The reaper decides in TypeScript (`lastSignOfLife`, src/lib/api/reconcile.ts)
 * and vitals decides in SQL (`task_genuine_activity_at`, migration 065). If
 * they disagreed, vitals would alarm `reaper-idle` about claims the reaper
 * rightly keeps, or say nothing about claims it is about to release. So each
 * case states the answer once, and both suites must produce it:
 * src/lib/liveness-fixtures.test.ts through lastSignOfLife, and
 * tests/integration/vitals-signals.test.ts through the SQL function.
 *
 * Times are hours before "now"; null is absent. `expectedHoursAgo` is the
 * last sign of life.
