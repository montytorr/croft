/**
 * Every write from the browser goes through `mutate` (or `useMutate`, which
 * also shows the failure).
 *
 * Hand-rolled, about half of them were wrong in one of four ways: no check on
 * the response at all, a silent rollback of optimistic state, reading
 * `json.error.message` when the envelope carries `error` as a string, or —
 * true of every single one — no try/catch, so a dropped connection left the
 * editor stuck on "Saving…" and dragged cards in lanes they never reached.
 *
 * The helper cannot force a component to show the message it returns. What it
 * can do is make sure nobody writes the raw version again.
