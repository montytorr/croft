/**
 * The content hash of the CLI this deployment was built from.
 *
 * WHY THE VERSION WAS NOT ENOUGH. CROFT-246 put the release version on every
 * response so a stale CLI could notice without being asked, and it works
 * exactly as designed — which turned out to be almost never. Releases are
 * cut by hand and 133 commits fitted inside v0.5.1, so nearly all real drift
 * is INTRA-version: both sides said 0.5.1 while the Mac's copy was missing
 * `--allow-dangling` on relearn and the whole vitals memory block, and no
 * warning was possible. A version says which release a copy belongs to; it
 * cannot say whether it is that release's current file (CROFT-261).
 *
 * A CONTENT HASH CAN, and it is the one identifier a copied file can compute
 * about itself. A CLI does not know which commit it came from — it is a
 * single file copied into ~/.local/bin, with no repository behind it — but it
 * can always read itself. That constraint is what made the version constant
 * the easy choice in the first place, and hashing is what removes it.
 *
 * Same digest as scripts/sync-agent-files.mjs: sha256, first 16 hex. The two
 * mechanisms then speak one language — the installer's log line and this
 * header print the same string for the same file, which is what makes "the
 * server says 05b4c2f4, my copy is e592a2f4" an answer rather than a puzzle.

/**
 * Read once, at module load, and never again: in the container the source
 * cannot change while the process lives, and this sits on the path every
 * response takes.
 *
 * Two sources, in order. `public/cli-hash.txt` is written by the Dockerfile
 * from the repository it built, the same way `public/build-version.txt`
 * records the commit — the standalone Next build does not trace `cli/` and
 * would not carry the file itself. Falling back to hashing the file in place
 * is what makes `npm run dev` and the test suite report a real fingerprint
 * rather than a special case.
 *
 * Null when neither is available, and null means the header is simply absent.
 * A CLI that hears nothing must go on working — the check is an improvement
 * on silence, never a dependency.

 * wrote it — so an image built after that is the newer side, and a CLI
