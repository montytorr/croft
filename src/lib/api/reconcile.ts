 * The backstop for claims that outlive the session that took them.

 * No runtime releases on session end. Claude Code's SessionEnd records the
 * session and checkpoints what it held; Codex has only Stop, and OpenClaw has
 * neither — its nearest equivalents are `command:new` and a daily auto-reset.
 * So on every runtime a claim can outlive its session, and the board fills
 * with holds nobody is acting on: 22 were held when CROFT-284 was filed, 17 of
 * them silent for more than 20 hours.
 *
 * Run on a schedule as the maintenance identity (`CROFT_AGENT=maintenance
 * croft reconcile`, installed by scripts/install-cron.mjs), this releases every
 * quiet claim in the workspace and says so on the task. Run by any other agent
 * it releases only that agent's own, which is all it ever did — and why the
 * scheduled job, holding nothing itself, released nothing for two weeks.
 *
 * A quiet `doing` task goes back to `todo`. An `in-review` one keeps its
 * status, because the work is written and the status says so; only the claim
 * goes. It deliberately never closes anything. A task without a resolution
 * that someone meant is worse than an open one: it looks answered and is not.
