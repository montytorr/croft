/**
 * Every response says which version served it, so a stale CLI can notice
 * without being asked.
 *
 * `croft --version` already compares the two, but that is the one command an
 * agent has no reason to run — so a copy that has drifted goes on working,
 * just not the way the docs say, until something it needs is missing. Putting
 * the number on the ordinary path costs a header and turns discovery-by-
 * accident into discovery.
 *
 * TWO HEADERS, BECAUSE THE VERSION ANSWERS A NARROWER QUESTION THAN IT LOOKS.
 * Releases are cut by hand and 133 commits fitted inside v0.5.1, so a copy
 * that is months of work behind still agrees on the number (CROFT-261). The
 * version stays — it is the right thing to say when the two sides belong to
 * different releases, and it is what a human reads — and the content hash
 * sits beside it for everything finer than that.
