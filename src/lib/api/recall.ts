/**
 * What Croft already knows that bears on one task (CROFT-268).
 *
 * `check` answers "has this subject been worked on" from a phrase. This starts
 * from a task and answers the question an agent has when it picks one up:
 * which decisions constrain it, and which facts apply. Two sources, one read:
 *
 *   decisions  resolutions, decision and finding notes on tasks related to
 *              this one — by a ref written either way (CROFT-267), by parent,
 *              child or dependency, or by a similar title
 *   knowledge  facts linked to the files this task touched (CROFT-269),
 *              learned on this task or a related one, or matching its terms
 *
 * Every line says why it was picked. A recall that cannot justify a line is a
 * search result wearing a better name, and the reader cannot tell which lines
 * to trust.
