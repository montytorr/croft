/**
 * Facts do not stay true, and nothing about a stale one looks any different.
 *
 * Half a dozen entries describing the Supabase stack became wrong the day the
 * migration to native PostgreSQL landed, and they went on reading exactly like
 * a fact confirmed this morning. `verified_at` existed and nothing used it.
 *
 * Croft already holds the evidence: `file_touches` maps paths to the sessions
 * and tasks that touched them, so for any fact that names files it can ask how
 * much has moved underneath it since it was last confirmed.
 *
 * Deliberately not expiry. A wrong confidence signal is worse than none, so
 * this marks and never hides, and a human or an agent decides.
 *
 * A fact that names no file has no such evidence, and 59% of the store names
 * none — the infra facts most of all (`clawdius-server` still described the
 * Supabase stack two weeks after it was removed). For those there is a second,
 * weaker mark: how long since anybody confirmed it. It is labelled apart from
 * `stale` on purpose. "Several sessions reworked the files under this" is
 * evidence; "nobody has looked in N days" is only a prompt to look, and must
 * never read as the first. Marked, not hidden, same as the other.

 * the database can keep `knowledge_files` from it; the knowledge-files
 * integration test holds the two to the same answers.
