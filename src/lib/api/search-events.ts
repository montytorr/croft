 *
 * This is the path that most directly answers "do agents call knowledge when

 * A MISS is the row worth having. An agent asking for a slug believed that
 * fact existed — usually because something in the corpus referenced it — so a
 * miss is a dangling reference being followed at the moment it fails, rather
 * than one found later by crawling the text. It is therefore recorded, not
 * merely absent.
 *
 * Kept out of `search_events` on purpose. `widened` is meaningless here, and
 * `result_count = 0` means the opposite of what it means for a search: for a
 * two-pass search an empty result is noise, for a slug lookup it is the whole
 * signal. See migration 053.
