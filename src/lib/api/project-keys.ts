 * What a project used to be called.

 * A ref is not an internal handle — it is designed to escape into commit
 * messages, PR titles and other agents' notes, all of which are immutable. A
 * rename cannot reach them, so the former key is kept and keeps resolving.
 *
 * Resolving is half of it. The other half is SAYING so (CROFT-264): AC was
 * renamed HOL, `croft show AC-113` returned HOL-113 with no explanation, and
 * `croft next --project AC` answered "nothing open" for a project with open
 * work. An agent holding the old key could not tell it had reached the same
 * thing, or that it had reached nothing because of a rename. So every lookup
 * that goes through a retired key returns a `KeyRename` beside its answer,
 * and every surface that received one passes it on.
