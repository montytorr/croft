 * asking: of 377 entries, 105 have no reference in or out, they fall into

 * wrote. All of it was invisible, because absence does not appear in a list —
 * a list shows what is there.

 * entries have always cross-referenced each other, so this reads them out of
 * the bodies with the same regex the renderer uses. Extracting them here, once
 * and on the server, also produces the one thing the renderer never had: the
 * complete set of slugs that exist, which is what lets a reference to
 * something unwritten be MARKED rather than silently linked into the void.
