 * The origin this deployment is actually served on.

 * `req.url` alone is wrong behind a reverse proxy that terminates TLS — which
 * is the deployment the README documents. The proxy forwards a plaintext
 * request, so the URL reads `http://`, while the browser announces `https://`,
 * and the comparison below could never match: every browser write was refused
 * with "Browser mutations must come from the Croft origin", including the first
 * agent key a fresh install has to issue.
 *
 * Trusting these headers assumes the application is reachable only through the
 * proxy — which the architecture already requires, since the container binds no
 * host port and sits on an internal network. A deployment that exposed the app
 * directly would let a client forge them, and would have larger problems.
 *
 * That assumption is narrower than it sounds, which is worth writing down
 * because it is the part a reader will worry about. The attack being kept out
 * is CSRF, and CSRF needs a browser to attach the victim's cookie. Neither
 * X-Forwarded header is CORS-safelisted, so a cross-origin page cannot set one
 * without a preflight, and this app sends no Access-Control-Allow-* header
 * anywhere, so that preflight is never approved. A client that can forge the
 * headers is not a browser, and so does not have the cookie the check exists
 * to protect. login/route.ts already keys its brute-force limiter on
 * X-Forwarded-For on the same reasoning, undocumented until now.
