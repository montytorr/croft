/**
 * The vital signs as an agent gets them, which is the whole of the report and

 *
 * `readMemoryUseFor` had exactly one call site — the Vitals page — so every
 * number about whether AGENTS consult the memory was visible only to a person
 * with a browser open. The things that write knowledge here cannot open one.
 * That is the failure knowledge/gaps/route.ts names in its own header, "the
 * findings were visible only to a person who happened to click Map", repeated
 * one panel over; it is why this read carries the memory block. See CROFT-254.
 *
 * Two round trips rather than one. The page already pays for both separately,
 * and folding memory into croft_vitals would mean rewriting a function five
 * migrations have transformed in order to move a number that is already there.
 *
 * `memory` is null rather than fatal when the aggregate cannot be read: this
 * endpoint is the monitor, and a monitor that returns 500 because one of its
 * two questions is unanswerable has stopped answering the other one too.
