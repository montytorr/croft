 * — so searches, widened searches, zero-result searches and work filed without
 * checking were answerable only by a person who opened the Vitals page. Every
 * writer of knowledge in this system is an agent, and an agent reads
 * `croft vitals` and GET /api/v1/vitals. Neither carried a byte of it.
 *
 * That is the failure knowledge/gaps/route.ts names in its own header, one
 * panel over: "the findings were visible only to a person who happened to
 * click Map". See CROFT-254.
