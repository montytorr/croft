/**
 * Query construction for prior-work discovery.
 *
 * Postgres full-text search ANDs the terms of a websearch query, which is the
 * right default for precision: an agent searching "supavisor pool timeouts"
 * wants the task about exactly that. It is the wrong behaviour when the agent
 * words the subject differently from whoever filed it, which is most of the
 * time — and a zero-result search reads as "this is new", the single most
 * expensive wrong answer this system can give.
 *
 * That was answered for years by trying the precise query first and widening
 * only when it came back thin, which is the shape `search_tasks` still has.
 * CROFT-247 measured what it cost in `search_all`: an AND over every content
 * word of a 9-13 word question matched the expected row 3 times in 22 live
 * searches, and the rows it DID match — long descriptions that happen to
 * contain every word somewhere — were enough to switch the widened arm off.
 * Three irrelevant rows suppressed the arm that answers the question.
 *
 * So, since migration 055: both arms always run and are merged. The precise
 * arm is no longer "every word of the sentence" but at least half of
 * `distinctiveTerms()`, counted per row, which is a superset of what it used
 * to match; the wide arm is the same OR it always was; and a row found by both
 * appears once, in the precise head.
