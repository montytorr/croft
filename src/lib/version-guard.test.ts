 * The CLI carries its own version number, because it is copied onto machines

 * copy in /usr/local/bin to read it from.
 *
 * That makes it exactly the kind of constant that goes stale silently. A CLI
 * three days out of date was found still writing under the wrong identity,
 * long after the fix had shipped, and nothing anywhere said so.
