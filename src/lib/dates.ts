 * Date formatting that survives hydration.
 *
 * `toLocaleDateString` with no `timeZone` resolves to the *runtime's* zone:
 * UTC in the container, Europe/Paris in the browser. Any timestamp near
 * midnight then renders as a different string on each side, and React throws
 * a hydration mismatch (#418) per offending row. With closed tasks included
 * that was ten errors and a visibly broken repaint on every project page.
 *
 * So every formatter here pins the zone explicitly, and anything that depends
 * on "now" is deferred to after mount rather than guessed at on the server.
