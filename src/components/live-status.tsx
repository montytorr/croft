 * says only THAT something moved, and the page then re-renders through its
 * normal server path (see CROFT-152). That is cheaper and more responsive than
 * a timer, but it is also invisible: a stream that quietly died looks exactly
 * like a workspace where nothing is happening, and an agent's findings land on
 * a page that never updates again. This says which of the two you are in.
 *
 * A countdown was the obvious thing to build and would have been a lie: the
 * server decides when to check, the browser is never told the schedule, so a
 * client-side timer would tick along happily over a dead connection.
