 * and a WebGL scene you can orbit. The shell owns the things that belong to
 * neither — what is under the pointer, the legend, the toggle — so that the
 * title bar reads the same whichever is mounted and hovering a node means the
 * same thing in both.
 *
 * three.js is a large dependency and it is only ever needed here, so the scene

 * to build its textures and reads the stylesheet for the palette, neither of
