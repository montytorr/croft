/**
 * The map as a place you can move through.
 *
 * The flat version of this page opens with an argument against exactly this,
 * and the argument has not stopped being true: depth puts things behind other
 * things, and the one finding the page exists to deliver is how much of the
 * corpus is joined to nothing. Three things answer it, and all three are load
 * bearing rather than decoration.
 *
 * The entries joined to nothing are not in the cloud. They sit on a lit disc
 * underneath it, in a sunflower spiral, and nothing is drawn between the
 * camera and that disc — see `layout3D`. You can orbit to any angle the
 * controls allow and still count them.
 *
 * The camera is clamped off both poles, so there is no angle from which the
 * cloud collapses to the edge-on line a free camera finds immediately.
 *
 * And the flat map is still here: still the fallback where WebGL is missing,
 * one click away on a toggle. Nothing was removed to add this.
 *
 * Geometry is instanced — one draw call for every sphere, one for every link,
 * one for the glow. Positions come from `layout3D`, which is deterministic, so
 * this scene is as stable between renders as the flat one: a `router.refresh()`
 * landing mid-orbit changes nothing about where anything is.
