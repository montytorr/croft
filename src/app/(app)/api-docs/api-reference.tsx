/**
 * Mounts the Scalar reference, and — the part that matters — unmounts it.
 *
 * Scalar is a full application, not a widget: it binds its own ⌘K palette to
 * the document. Croft binds ⌘K too, so leaving this page without tearing
 * Scalar down meant the API endpoint search kept opening over every other page
 * in the app. Nothing looked broken on /api-docs itself; the damage was
 * everywhere else, which is the usual shape of a leak in a single-page app.
 *
 * `createApiReference` returns a handle with `destroy()`. The effect calls it
 * on unmount, so the listener leaves with the page that wanted it.
 *
 * Two further notes. The version is pinned because this page rendered nothing
 * at all after a CDN bump — older builds self-mounted from a `<div data-url>`,
 * the current one does nothing until called, and the script loaded
 * successfully either way. And the script tag is left in place deliberately: a
 * loaded library binds nothing on its own, and removing it would only force a
 * re-download on the next visit.
