 * while every one of the 377 real slugs uses hyphens — the convention came in
 * wholesale with the claude-mem import and nothing reconciled the two.
 *
 * That is not cosmetic. `croft know <subject>` only attempts a fetch when the
 * subject looks like a slug, so an underscore spelling fell through to
 * full-text search and could miss the entry entirely while looking like an
 * answer. Normalising on lookup makes both spellings resolve without
 * rewriting anything anybody wrote.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: case and separator only. Anything cleverer — stripping
 * words, fuzzy matching — would resolve a reference to something its author
 * did not mean, which is worse than not resolving it.
