-- ===========================================================================
-- 063: a session-end checkpoint is not a sign of life, and a release means it
--
-- CROFT-283. checkpointHeldTasks wrote a summary onto every task the actor's
-- label held, and every write went through tasks_touch, so updated_at said
-- "just edited" on claims nobody had opened in a week. The reaper reads
-- updated_at as liveness, so those claims could never go quiet, and the text
-- replaced whatever real checkpoint was there: 28 tasks lost one.
--
-- The policy (which tasks, which text, never over a written checkpoint) lives
-- in src/lib/api/sessions.ts, where it is pure and unit-tested. What lives here
-- is what has to be atomic: the write only lands if the claim, its generation
-- and the checkpoint it was planned against are all still what the plan saw,
-- and it leaves updated_at alone.
--
-- CROFT-284. A release now clears claimed_session, and a manual release moves
-- a held `doing` task back to `todo` the way the reaper already did. The
-- reaper's optimistic check compares timestamps at millisecond precision,
-- which is all the application can hand back (see reconcile_task_atomic).
-- Both functions are rebuilt from their CURRENT definitions (047); nothing
-- between 047 and here redefined them.
-- ===========================================================================

-- A write that is bookkeeping, not activity, says so for the length of one
-- statement. Transaction-local and reset by the caller straight after, so it
-- cannot leak onto a later write in the same transaction. Deliberately not
-- `alter table ... disable trigger`, which takes an exclusive lock on tasks
-- from a request path.
