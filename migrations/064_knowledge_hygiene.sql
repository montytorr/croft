-- 064: knowledge hygiene — provenance, sweep-proof recall, length-fair ranking
--      (CROFT-289)
--
-- Measured by the CROFT-282 audit over the live store (425 rows):
--
--   * 0 rows carry source_session_id or source_task_id. The CLI already sends
--     the session on every request (X-Croft-Session); nothing stored it.
--   * 1,169 of 1,243 knowledge_reads came from audit loops reading 10-141
--     distinct slugs a minute, and every one marked its entry as recalled
--     (062), so 370 of 424 entries looked used and `know --unused` could not
--     find the ~211 nobody has ever been given.
--   * 11 imported entries over 5k tokens (2.6% of the store) took 28% of the
--     knowledge result slots, because ts_rank without normalisation rewards a
--     long body for containing every word somewhere.
--
-- Four parts, one file, all in the migration runner's transaction.
-- ===========================================================================

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Provenance: the session as its runtime named it.
--
-- knowledge.source_session_id references sessions(id), and a sessions row is
-- normally written at session END — after the fact was learned. So the
-- foreign key is filled when the row already exists and otherwise stays null,
-- and the external id is kept beside it for readers to resolve through
-- sessions.external_id once the session has ended.
--
-- Resolving it later by updating knowledge is deliberately not done: every
-- UPDATE of a knowledge row fires knowledge_touch (013) and would stamp the
-- fact as just edited, reorder every updated_at list and put a fabricated edit
-- in the activity feed — the failure 062's header describes for recall.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

alter table knowledge add column if not exists source_session_ref text;

comment on column knowledge.source_session_ref is
  'The session that wrote this entry, as its runtime named it (X-Croft-Session). '
  'source_session_id is filled only when that session''s row already existed; '
  'otherwise resolve this through sessions.external_id.';

-- sessions_external_idx leads with platform_source, which the header does
-- not carry; this is the lookup that resolves a ref without it.
create index if not exists sessions_external_id_idx on sessions (external_id);

alter table knowledge_revisions add column if not exists edited_session text;

comment on column knowledge_revisions.edited_session is
  'The session that made the edit which replaced this version, when the caller named one.';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Sweeps are reads, not recalls.
--
-- Kept as rows — a sweep is still something that happened — and tagged so
-- that nothing counting recall counts them. Two ways in:
--   * declared: the CLI sends X-Croft-Read: sweep (`know --sweep`,
--     CROFT_SWEEP=1) and the API writes sweep = true;
--   * inferred: the audit loops declared nothing, so a read is also a sweep
--     when the same actor has already read 9 OTHER slugs in the last minute.
--     Organic use measured at most a handful a minute; the loops ran 10-141.
--     The first nine reads of an undeclared burst still count — a live read
--     cannot know the burst is coming — which bounds the leak at nine
--     entries per burst instead of all of them. History is tagged whole (4).

-- 3. History: tag the sweeps already recorded, then recompute recall state.
--
-- Symmetric window for the past, because here the whole burst is visible:
-- a read is a sweep when its actor read 10+ distinct slugs within a minute
-- either side of it. knowledge_reads carries no touch trigger and its only
-- other trigger fires on insert, so this rewrites nothing else.
--
-- knowledge_recall_state is derived data (062) that only ever moves forward,
-- so it cannot un-count a sweep in place. It is rebuilt from the same
-- function it was first built from, which now leaves sweeps out.

-- 4. Ranking stops rewarding length.
--
-- ts_rank(vec, q) with no normalisation grows with how often the terms occur,
-- so an 11k-token import that mentions everything outranks the short entry
-- that answers the question. Normalisation 1 divides by 1 + log(document
-- length) — gentle, a long body still wins when it is genuinely denser — and
-- 32 maps the result into [0,1) without changing order. Applied to every
-- kind and to both arms, so the merge stays one ordering (055's invariant):
-- normalising knowledge alone would demote every fact below every task.
--
-- TRANSFORMED, NOT RE-COPIED, as 055 was: this edits the definition actually
-- installed (038, as 048 and 055 left it), and each anchor must appear exactly
-- twice — once in an arm's select list and once in its order by — or the
-- migration refuses to guess.
