-- 016: search_all — one verb reaches everything an agent has ever written
--
-- `croft check` is the first instruction in the skill, and until now it has
-- searched exactly one thing: tasks. Meanwhile the skill's other insistence is
-- that agents record findings and dead ends as notes, "tried X, no difference
-- is as valuable as a fix".
--
-- Those two instructions did not meet. task_notes has carried its own GIN
-- index since 001 and nothing has ever queried it, so all 190 notes -- every
-- dead end anybody bothered to write down -- were unreachable from the one
-- verb told to find them. Comments were reachable only by accident, through
-- the denormalised tasks.comments_text.
--
-- This adds knowledge and sessions in the same pass, so there is one index to
-- read rather than four places to look.
--
-- Ranking is inherited wholesale from search_tasks and for the same measured
-- reasons (004, 006, 007): a precise websearch_to_tsquery pass, widened to OR
-- only when the precise pass comes back under p_min_precise, ts_rank as the
-- primary sort, ordered inside Postgres. 006 proved coverage-first is worse
-- (87%->81%) and re-sorting in the application dropped recall from 75% to 6%.
--
-- Deliberately NOT weighting one kind above another. A curated knowledge row
-- arguably deserves a boost over an offhand note, but that is a guess, and the
-- one time this project ranked on a plausible theory instead of a measurement
-- it had to be reverted. Kind breaks ties and nothing more. Measure first.
