-- Croft's own vital signs.
--
-- Three failures this week were found by a person looking, not by the system
-- saying anything: sessions silently recorded nothing for two days, ten tasks
-- sat in In Progress with nobody on them, and every automatic release was
-- filed under the wrong agent. None of them threw an error. Each one was a
-- number that should not have been what it was.
--
-- One round trip, because a health check that costs eight queries is a health
-- check that gets run rarely and then not at all. The window is a parameter so
-- the same function answers "is anything wrong right now" and "what did last
-- week look like".
