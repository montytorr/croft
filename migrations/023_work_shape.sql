-- Where the work is stuck, rather than who did the most of it.
--
-- The tempting version of this is a leaderboard: tasks closed per agent,
-- writes per agent. It would be actively harmful. The agents read Croft -- it
-- is their working memory, and the skill tells them to close with a resolution
-- -- so a visible closure score creates an incentive to close things, which is
-- the one behaviour least worth optimising. A resolution written to move a
-- number is worse than an open task, because it looks answered.
--
-- So: no ranking. Per agent, only what is actionable -- what it is holding now
-- and what it walked away from. The rest is about the work itself.
