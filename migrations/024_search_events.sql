-- Croft's whole premise is `croft check` before starting work, and nothing
-- recorded whether that happened. Every other number here describes what was
-- written; none described whether any of it was read. A store nobody queries is
-- an expensive way to write into a drawer.

-- The query text is kept on purpose. A search that returns nothing is the most
-- informative row in this table: it says what the memory was asked for and did
-- not have.
