-- 013: knowledge — what we know, as opposed to what we did
--
-- Every row in Croft so far hangs off a task, and a task hangs off exactly one
-- project. That leaves nowhere to put the thing an agent most often needs:
-- "one overflow axis set to auto forces the other from visible to auto", or
-- "this laptop cannot reach that host's public IP, and it is the VPN rather
-- than the DNS". Those belong to no task, and usually to no single project.
--
-- Two design decisions worth stating, because both are reactions to measured
-- failures in the store this replaces:
--
--   * Zero project links means global. There is no `scope` column to drift out
--     of agreement with the join table.
--
--   * `superseded_by` exists because the failure mode of every memory store we
--     have looked at is accumulation without correction. claude-mem holds
--     29,090 append-only rows and offers no way to say "that is no longer
--     true" — so the WireGuard correction above would have sat alongside the
--     Tailscale claim it replaced, both equally findable.
