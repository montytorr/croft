-- ===========================================================================
-- 065: vitals can see quiet claims, a dead reaper, a failing summariser and a
--      runtime that stopped
--
-- CROFT-282 recomputed every vitals number against production and every one
-- matched its SQL. The panel still read "nothing wrong in the last 24h" while:
--
--   * 17 of 22 held claims had shown no sign of life for more than 20h, and
--     the reaper had released nothing since 2026-09-12. `stalled` counts only
--     UNclaimed work, `held` is a bare count, and `claims-abandoned` needs
--     five automatic releases — which a dead reaper holds at zero. The one
--     check that should have caught it was structurally unable to fire.
--   * 1 of 16 sessions was summarised on 09-24 (openclaw 0/8, codex 0/2),
--     against about 75% the week before. The alarm fires only at zero.
--   * codex recorded nothing for 24h and openclaw's scheduled runs stopped on
--     09-20. Sessions were only ever totalled, never split by runtime.
--   * 421 of 424 current knowledge entries had never been verified.
--   * the summariser's own `claude -p` runs were being recorded as sessions,
--     inflating the volume and diluting the summarised share.
--
-- A NEW FUNCTION, NOT A SEVENTH TRANSFORMATION OF croft_vitals. Everything
-- here is new data rather than a change to a number croft_vitals already
-- returns, and five migrations have rewritten that function by editing its
-- installed text (048, 050, 051, 054; 050 once by re-copying, which reverted
-- 048). Adding six CTEs to it through string surgery is how the next one of
-- those goes wrong. The app reads both, in parallel, and treats this one as
-- optional so that a database without it still answers the monitor.
--
-- Workspace-wide, like everything 048 left behind: p_owner is accepted for
-- the same N-1 call shape and deliberately unused.
-- ===========================================================================

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What counts as someone actually being on a claim.
--
-- THE REAPER'S DEFINITION, IN SQL. `lastSignOfLife` in src/lib/api/reconcile.ts
-- decides what gets released; this decides what vitals calls quiet. If they
-- disagreed, vitals would either alarm about claims the reaper rightly keeps
-- (a false `reaper-idle`) or stay silent about claims it is about to release.
-- So this reads exactly the reaper's inputs and applies exactly its rule, and
-- src/lib/liveness-fixtures.ts pins both to the same cases: the unit suite runs
-- them through lastSignOfLife, tests/integration/vitals-signals.test.ts through
-- this function. Change one, change the other, and the fixtures.
--
-- Signs of life: the claim itself, an explicit heartbeat, a note, the task
-- row's updated_at, an evidence event recorded by the holder, and the stored
-- checkpoint — except the one written
-- without anyone looking. "Still held, not progressed" is the session-end hook
-- recording that a claim was held while the session worked elsewhere, and
-- counting it let a runtime that records a session every 30 minutes keep a
-- week-old claim alive forever (CROFT-283).
--
-- updated_at is safe to read since 063: auto_checkpoint_task_atomic writes
-- under a transaction-local flag that touch_updated_at honours, so the
-- session-end sweep no longer stamps every held claim as just edited.
--
-- Evidence events are CLAIM_EVIDENCE_EVENTS.genuine in reconcile.ts — a
-- commit, push, test run, deliberate checkpoint or status move — and only
-- when recorded by the claim's holder: somebody else moving the task is not
-- the holder working on it. Its `ignored` list (auto_checkpointed, released,
-- claimed) is excluded by not being named; 063's automatic checkpoint is the
-- one that must never count.
