-- 015: file_touches — recall keyed to a path, with no query to write
--
-- The single best retrieval mechanism in the store this replaces, and the only
-- one that needed no agent discipline at all: before a file is read, say what
-- is already known about it. No search string, no decision to remember, no
-- tool call the model has to choose to make.
--
-- Croft has had no file index whatsoever -- `croft files` lists attachments.
--
-- Nothing here costs a model call. Paths come straight out of a transcript at
-- session end, or off `croft note --file`. That is the whole reason this is
-- affordable when per-tool-use observation was not.
--
-- Paths are stored repo-relative where a repo root can be determined, absolute
-- otherwise. Storing both forms of the same file would split its history in
-- two, which is exactly the failure this table exists to avoid.

comment on table file_touches is
  'Which sessions, tasks and knowledge concern a given file. Populated '
  'deterministically -- never by a model -- so it stays cheap enough to write '
  'on every session.';
comment on index file_touches_base_idx is
  'Basename lookup, for when the caller has a path rooted differently from the '
  'one that was recorded.';
