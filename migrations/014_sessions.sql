-- 014: sessions — the episodic record, written without being asked
--
-- Croft holds open loops and durable answers. What it has never held is "what
-- happened in that conversation last Tuesday", and until now the honest answer
-- was to send people to claude-mem for it.
--
-- Of everything that store produced, the session summary is the piece worth
-- keeping: a request/learned/completed/next_steps quartet, one per session.
-- The rest of it -- 29,090 observations generated one per tool call -- cost
-- ~1,114 billed turns a day and was consulted 103 times in seventeen days.
-- This table takes the good half at one model call per session, which measured
-- against real usage is 30-120 a day.
--
-- `external_id` plus `platform_source` is the idempotency key. A session-end
-- hook that fires twice, or a reconciler that sweeps up a session the hook
-- missed, must not produce two rows.
