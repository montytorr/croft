-- 017: task_projects — work that spans several projects
--
-- A task lives in exactly one project and takes its ref from that project's
-- counter. That is worth keeping: CAI-42 is a stable name precisely because
-- nothing moves it.
--
-- But some work genuinely belongs to several projects at once -- an infra
-- change that lands in four services, a convention adopted everywhere. Until
-- now the choice was to file it in the wrong place or to file it four times.
--
-- So: the home project stays, and secondary links are additive. The task shows
-- up in the other projects' lists, boards and filters as a guest, keeping its
-- original ref.
--
-- Worth recording because it is already true and nobody has used it: parent_id
-- is a plain task FK with no same-project constraint, so sub-tasks can already
-- live in different projects. An epic in CROFT with children in HM and AT
-- works today. What was missing is only that nothing shows which project a
-- child is in.
