-- 019: activity_feed — one timeline of everything that happened
--
-- Croft records six kinds of event and every one of them is reachable only
-- from the thing it belongs to. That answers "what is the state of CROFT-64"
-- and never answers "what did they all do today", which is the question a
-- person actually has after a day of agents working.
--
-- A union in SQL rather than five queries stitched together in the
-- application, because the ordering has to happen before the limit. Doing that
-- the other way round is the single mistake this codebase has made most often
-- -- the knowledge list, the scope ranking and the entity filter all shipped
-- with a filter applied to an already-limited page, and each looked correct
-- until the corpus outgrew the limit.
--
-- Keyset pagination on `at`, not OFFSET: the feed grows from the head, so an
-- offset page drifts as soon as anything new arrives.
